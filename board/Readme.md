## Electrosense frequency converter board

The board extends the frequency range of an SDR from DC to 6GHz. The design was orignally made with Altium Designer 17 and edited using Altium Designer 20.

In the design folder, "Template2.PcbDoc" is the full board layout, and "imped50.PcbDoc" and "imped_control.PcbDoc" are used to indicate traces that require impedance control.

The fabrication folder contains the board layout gerber files and the final BOM. The BOM does not include SMA connectors or the CPU programming header. The MPN column lists the original part numbers. Entries highlighted in red are parts that have been listed twice due to the way Altium generates the BOM. The alternate MPN column lists the alternate parts that were all used as replacements.
